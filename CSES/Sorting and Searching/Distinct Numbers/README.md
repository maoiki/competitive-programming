# Solution/explanation
There are two ways to solve this problem: 
1) Using `sets` and printing its length 
2) Sorting the array and comparing if the current item is different from the previous one, then updating a counter. At the end you print the counter.

In python i've coded the two different approaches to better exemplify them.

## Notes:
### üêç Python
If you don't sort the array before turning it into a set, you get a "TIME LIMIT EXCEEDED" error in CSES when you submit it.
